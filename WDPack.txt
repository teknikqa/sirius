
You will need to download WinPcap developer's pack (WDPack) in order to compile

The project is set up to use WDPack 2.3 from <project_dir>\WPdpack

In order to change this you will need to fix the includes and lib
inside the source files and the project

Download WDPack from http://winpcap.polito.it
